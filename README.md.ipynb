    "- Deal with null values\n",

    "- Remove unwanted variables (ex. Home ID)\n",

    "- Normalize the data\n",
    "- Convert categorical values\n",

A 'good' condition denotes that the home requires no obvious maintenance and that appearance and utility are above standard; this condition will increase the sale price of the house by about 31.5 thousand dollars if no other variables about the house are changed. \n",

Houses that are in 'very good' condition are very will maintained, and show that many things have been overhauled and repaired over time, greatly increasing the life expectancy and utility of the home. \n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing Grade: Grade is represented on a 1 to 13 scale with a grade of 6 achieving the lowest grade to meet current building codes. Grades 7 and above generally mean that the house has increasing architectural design, better construction and higher overall design quality. In simpler terms, this can denote the quality of cosmetic appearance such as wood finishings and bathroom fixtures. Remodeling a home to increase by 1 grade point will yield an increase in price of about 83 thousand dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing square footage of living space: For every square foot of living space, the home will increase in value by about 72 dollars. A better rule of thumb would be to frame this in a larger scale; adding a wreck room or family room on to the house that adds 500 square feet of living room will increase the sale price of the home by about 36 thousand dollars. \n",
